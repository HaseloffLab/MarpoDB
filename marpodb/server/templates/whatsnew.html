				<h2>03/07/17 - Version 3</h2>
				<h3 class="about_text">
					We are happy to present our new release, which features the following changes:
				
				<ul>
					<li> We have reassembled our Cam-1 transcriptomic and genomic reads into a new dataset. </li>
					<li> We have included the complete InterPro scan dataset, so now you can search by InterPro ID or GO term.</li>
					<li> We have removed all unannotated and non-primary transcripts ( based on CDS length ), leaving clean dataset of 12722 genes. </li>
					<li> We have added <a href = "/hmmer">HMMER to MarpoDB</a> feature, so now you can search for candidates using STOCKHOLM - formatted sequence alignments.</li>
					<li> You can now assign names for genes, when you star them (only for registred users).</li>
				</ul>

				We hope you are going to like it. If you have any problems or suggestions please do not hesitate to contact us.
